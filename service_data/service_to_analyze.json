They are experts in their field and quick to offer support to victims and families in times of crisis. From an investigative perspective they have been quick to assist in helping us to expand the reach and timeliness of our messaging in instances where we have had to activate our Amber Alert protocol. I have been impressed with their responsiveness and willingness to engage and provide support at all hours in those critical first few hours of a high risk missing child investigation. On the public education front we could not ask for a better ally in producing and delivering relevant and effective materials and messaging to youth, parents and key community leaders. As our approach to missing persons investigations continues to evolve, the Canadian Center for Child Protection will remain a key and trusted partner.”\n— Chief Superintendent Mark Fisher, OIC Criminal Operations, “D” Division RCMP\n--- Content from https://missingkids.ca/en/about/contact/ ---\nWe appreciate your feedback.
