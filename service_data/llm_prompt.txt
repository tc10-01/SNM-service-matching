Donation FAQs Can I fundraise on C3P\u2019s behalf?&nbsp; We encourage all individuals who wish to support our organization financially to do so by donating directly through our website at www.protectchildren.ca or through CanadaHelps.org. Please note that we do not engage in direct marketing (e.g., phone solicitation, door-to-door sales, etc.), nor do we authorize or endorse third party fundraising,* except in very limited circumstances and with established partners. If you are an individual or entity who wishes to organize fundraising events or initiative on our behalf, please understand that as a registered charity we are subject to several tax and other rules that are not conducive to this type of fundraising without a high degree of oversight by our organization. We simply do not have the resources or the staff to responsibly manage these types of events or initiatives if we are to remain focused on our core mission of protecting children and reducing child victimization. We kindly ask that you please refrain from carrying out such events or initiatives, and from using any of our logos, registered trademarks, or other materials to promote your event or initiative unless otherwise authorized by our organization. Please note that if we have not directly endorsed or promoted a third party fundraising event or campaign on our own website or social media channels, you can assume it is not authorized by our organization. * Third party fundraising refers to an event or campaign that is initiated by an individual or entity whereby that individual or entity has indicated that all or some portion of the proceeds will be donated or given to support the Canadian Centre for Child Protection Inc. Will I receive a tax receipt for my donation? We issue tax receipts for one-time donations of $10 or more. When you make a one-time donation online through our website, you will be given the option to download an official tax receipt in PDF format. You will also be sent a copy by email. When you make a monthly donation through CanadaHelps.org, an official tax receipt will be sent to the email address provided. How can I contact the Canadian Centre for Child Protection about a donation? To donate by phone, you can call our toll-free number at 1-800-532-9135"
